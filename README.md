# ECE395_finalproject
This is a dungeon gameI created with a classmate for ECE39500(Object Oriented Programming) at Purdue.
All the files necessary to run the dungeon are inside the src directory. The directory 'game' contains the bulk of the logic behind programmin the dungeon. The directory xmlfiles contains the xml files needed to initialize the dungeon. The directory asciipanel contains the code necessary to generate the window where the game is displayed. 

The game can be run from the src directory with the following line: 'java game.Rogue <xmlfile>'
